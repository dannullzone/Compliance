This is a Hardening Guide


1. Keep Windows Updated Enable automatic Windows Update Regularly patch the OS, browsers, Office, and other apps
2. User Account & Privilege Hardening Disable the local Administrator account or rename it Use least privilege: regular users shouldnâ€™t have admin rights Implement User Account Control (UAC) Enforce strong, complex passwords and password policies (length, lockout) Use separate accounts for admin tasks
3. Secure Remote Access Disable unused remote access (e.g., Remote Desktop if not needed) Restrict RDP access to specific users/IPs (use firewalls) Require Network Level Authentication (NLA) for RDP Use VPN for remote access Enable RDP logging and brute-force detection
4. Harden Network Services Disable unnecessary services and protocols (SMBv1, Telnet, FTP, Print Spooler, etc.) Close unused network ports (with Windows Firewall or third-party) Enable Windows Defender Firewall and configure with appropriate rules
5. System & Application Hardening Remove or disable unneeded features (e.g., Internet Explorer, legacy components) Enable Windows Defender Antivirus and Real-time Protection Use AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control to restrict allowed applications Apply recommended CIS or Microsoft Security Baseline policy templates
6. Logging & Auditing Enable event logging for success and failure in Security logs Set log retention and monitor logs regularly (Event Viewer, SIEM) Enable Audit Policy for key events: logon, object access, privilege use
